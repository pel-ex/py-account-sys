# py-account-sys
Python account system that can read and write to a file to see if an account is valid or make one. Do whatever you want with this system. Could be a lot better but it wasn't made to be good.

## Useage
Can be used to 'lock' access to a file and launch it on login.
Change {file_path} to your CSV file. Or change the destination variable before running the code.

## Use
Do whatever with it. No longer being updated. No longer need to work on it - finished the course.

# py-account-sys
Python account system that can read and write to a file to see if an account is valid or make one. Do whatever you want with this system. Could be a lot better but it wasn't made to be good.

## Installation
As a demo for what can be accessed on the account system I incorporated a small arcade game.

```bash
py -m pip install freegames
```
